ImageJ Macro for measuring fiber diameter in muscle cross-section images

The MyoSAT (Myofiber Segmentation and Analysis Tool) image-processing pipeline is a software tool designed to measure the minimium feret diameter of myofibers in a muscle cross-section. Results will include a myofiber count and distribution of minimium feret diameters. MyoSAT combines several unconventional approaches including advanced background leveling, Perona-Malik anisotropic diffusion filtering, and Stegerâ€™s line detection algorithm to aid in pre-processing and enhancement of the muscle image. Final segmentation is based upon marker-based watershed segmentation. The MyoSAT software tool has been implemented as a macro for the freely available ImageJ software platform. This new segmentation tool allows scientists to efficiently analyze large muscle cross-sections for use in research studies and diagnostics.

MyoSAT has been tested using collagen V labeled cross-sections. Required for use is a .tif image of the muscle cross-section. A mask image will also be needed if the image contains areas without myofibers. A mask image should be a .tif file of identical pixel dimensions, with black (0 value in ImageJ) in areas that will no be analyzed and white (max value in ImageJ) in areas that will be analyzed. Instructions in how to generate these images using the open source program GIMP will follow.
